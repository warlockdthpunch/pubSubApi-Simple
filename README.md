## About Pub/Sub API
Welcome to Pub/Sub API! Pub/Sub API provides a single interface for publishing and subscribing to platform events, including real-time event monitoring events, and change data capture events. Based on [gRPC](https://grpc.io/docs/what-is-grpc/introduction/) and HTTP/2, Pub/Sub API enables efficient delivery of binary event messages in the Apache Avro format.

This repo contains the critical [proto
file](https://github.com/developerforce/pub-sub-api/blob/main/pubsub_api.proto) that you will need to use the API. 

## gRPC
gRPC [officially supports 11 languages](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/), but
there is unofficial community support in more. To encode and decode events, an
Avro library for your language of choice will be needed. See below for which
officially supported languages have well-supported Avro libraries:

|Supported gRPC Language|Avro Libraries|

If you have a code sample for Pub/Sub API that you would like to add a link to in this section, submit a PR with the modified readme page. We don't guarantee that we can link to all samples. Priority will be given to samples implemented in a programming language that is not represented in this repository's samples.
